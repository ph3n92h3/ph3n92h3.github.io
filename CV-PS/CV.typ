+ Z.~Feng, W.~Jia(CUHK), J.~q.~Wu, "A Noether's Theorem Resolution of the Holographic Gravitational Anomaly," in preparation.
  - We study asymptotic symmetries and conserved charges in three-dimensional topological massive gravity with a general asymptotically AdS boundary condition. Starting from the holographically renormalized Einstein-Hilbert plus gravitational Chern-Simons action, we apply Noether's theorem and show that asymptotic diffeomorphisms preserving the boundary conditions are symmetries of the renormalized action in the strict Noether sense. The non-conservation of the associated Noether charges is governed by a configuration-independent boundary 2-form, which encodes the holographic gravitational and Weyl anomalies and serves as the anomaly inflow for the dual field theory. We further demonstrate that the variation of these Noether charges matches that of the covariant phase space charges and that the resulting charges agree with those obtained from the holographic stress tensor, reproducing the known consistent anomalies. This provides a conceptually clean Noetherian resolution of the holographic gravitational anomaly for $"AdS"_3\/"CFT"_2$.
+ Z.~Feng, Z.~e.~Gao, X.~S.~Wang, J.~q.~Wu, H.~Zhang(BNU), "Applying Noether's theorem to the pure $"AdS"_3$ gravity," in preparation.
  - In this paper, we revisit the approach with the covariant phase space formalism for the asymptotic symmetry analysis in the pure $"AdS"_3$ gravity. We modify the approach to a version which is exactly in the framework of Noether's theorem. The key point in the modification is to take a systematical treatment of the boundary effects.
  - In particular, we start from defining the pure $"AdS"_3$ gravity in Lagrangian formalism, where we adopt proper asymptotic boundary conditions, and we take holographic renormalization in the off-shell level. We then follow Noether's theorem step by step with a careful treatment of the boundary terms.
  - Following our modified approach, we get the following three results. First, we show that the asymptotic symmetries are indeed symmetries of the pure $"AdS"_3$ gravity in the sense of Noether's theorem. Second, we compute the charges of the asymptotic symmetries with the expression of Noether charge, which reproduces the same result from the ordinarily used approach with the covariant phase space formalism. Third, we compute of the brackets between the charges of the asymptotic symmetries for a general metric of the asymptotic boundary.
