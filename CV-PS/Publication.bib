  abstract      = {In the context of $f\left(R, T\right) = R + 2 \beta T$ gravity, where $R$ is the Ricci scalar and $T$ is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, the equilibrium structure of charged anisotropic white dwarfs (WDs) is studied. The stellar equations for the general case are derived and numerical solutions are found for the Chandrasekhar equation of state (EoS) and a charge density distribution proportional to the energy density $\rho_{\text{ch}} = \alpha \rho$. By adjusting different parameters, the properties of the solutions under various conditions are compared. Most importantly, by going beyond the trivial WD in GR in various ways, the solutions may exhibit super-Chandrasekhar behavior. This article is a study of a WD structure, and the results obtained may have a contrasting effect on astronomical observations such as superluminous type Ia supernovae.},

  abstract      = {In the framework of $f\left(R, T, R_{ab}T^{ab}\right)$ gravity theory, the slow-roll approximation of the cosmic inflation is investigated, where $T$ is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $T^{ab}$, $R$ and $R_{ab}$ are the Ricci scalar and tensor, respectively. After obtaining the equations of motion of the gravitational field from the action principle in the spatially flat FLRW metric, the fundamental equations of this theory are received by introducing the inflation scalar field as the matter and taking into account only the minimum curvature-inflation coupling term. Remarkably, after taking the slow-roll approximation, the identical equations as in $f(R, T)$ gravity with a $RT$ mixing term are derived. Several potentials of interest in different domains are evaluated individually, calculating the slow-roll parameter and the e-folding number $N$. Finally, we analyze the behavior of the inflation scalar field under perturbation while ignoring the effect of metric perturbations. This research complements the slow-roll inflation in the modified theory of gravity.},
